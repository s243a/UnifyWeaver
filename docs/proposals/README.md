# UnifyWeaver Proposals

This directory contains design proposals for major features and architectural changes to UnifyWeaver.

## Purpose

Proposals serve several purposes:

1. **Planning:** Document design decisions before implementation
2. **Discussion:** Provide a basis for community feedback
3. **Documentation:** Capture the "why" behind architectural choices
4. **Roadmap:** Show the long-term vision for the project

## Proposal Lifecycle

### 1. Draft
- Proposal is written and committed
- Status: `Draft`
- Open for discussion and iteration

### 2. Accepted
- Proposal has been reviewed and approved
- Status: `Accepted`
- Implementation may begin

### 3. Implemented
- Feature has been fully implemented
- Status: `Implemented`
- Proposal becomes historical reference

### 4. Rejected
- Proposal was considered but not accepted
- Status: `Rejected`
- Document includes rationale for rejection

### 5. Superseded
- Proposal replaced by newer design
- Status: `Superseded by [proposal name]`
- Kept for historical context

## Active Proposals

| Proposal | Status | Target Version | Priority |
|----------|--------|----------------|----------|
| [Parallel Architecture](parallel_architecture.md) | Draft | v0.0.4+ | High (Phase 4) |

## Proposal Template

When creating a new proposal, include:

### Required Sections
1. **Executive Summary** - Brief overview (2-3 paragraphs)
2. **Motivation** - Why is this needed?
3. **Design Goals** - What properties should the solution have?
4. **Architecture Overview** - High-level design
5. **Implementation Phases** - How will this be built incrementally?
6. **Examples** - Concrete use cases
7. **Open Questions** - Unresolved design decisions

### Optional Sections
- **Performance Considerations**
- **Security Implications**
- **Backward Compatibility**
- **Alternative Approaches**
- **Related Work**
- **Success Criteria**

## Proposal Format

```markdown
# Proposal: [Feature Name]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Proposed Implementation Phase:** Phase N (vX.Y.Z)

## Executive Summary
[2-3 paragraph overview]

## Motivation
[Why this is needed]

## Design Goals
[List of goals]

## Architecture Overview

... [additional sections]
```

## Submitting a Proposal

1. Create a new markdown file in `docs/proposals/`
2. Follow the proposal template
3. Set status to `Draft`
4. Open a pull request for discussion
5. Update based on feedback
6. Change status to `Accepted` when ready

## Discussion Process

- Use GitHub issues for high-level discussion
- Use pull request comments for specific feedback
- Document key decisions in the proposal itself
- Update proposal with rationale for changes

## Implementation

Once a proposal is accepted:

1. Break into implementation tasks
2. Track in GitHub issues/project board
3. Reference proposal in commit messages
4. Update proposal status when complete

## Philosophy

Good proposals:
- Are **specific** - concrete examples over abstract descriptions
- Are **incremental** - show how to build iteratively
- Are **pragmatic** - consider real-world constraints
- Are **honest** - acknowledge trade-offs and unknowns

The goal is to make good decisions through thoughtful design, not to create bureaucracy.
