# Future XML Tooling Directions

This note captures ideas for building out UnifyWeaver’s XML capabilities beyond the current `xml_source` plugin. It is a scratchpad—update it as new use cases appear or when we learn more about the tools.

## 1. Engine Landscape (Current & Potential)

| Engine/Tool | Strengths | Weaknesses | Notes / Possible Work |
|-------------|-----------|------------|-----------------------|
| **Python / lxml.etree.iterparse** (`engine(iterparse)`) | True streaming; deterministic memory usage; Python’s full power (XPath, XSLT, schema validation via `lxml` add-ons) | Requires `lxml` wheel; Python dependency | - Extend to expose incremental XPath filters (e.g. allow users to supply Python predicates for complex conditions)<br>- Explore packaging a reusable Python module so other plugins can reuse the streaming logic |
| **xmllint** (`engine(xmllint)`) | Part of `libxml2` suite; fast XPath evaluator; rich CLI options (validation, XInclude, DTD processing) | CLI emits concatenated output; currently relies on embedded Python for splitting/reformatting; streaming support limited to validation | - Investigate pure-shell splitter to drop Python dependency when `namespace_fix(false)`<br>- Add configuration hooks for validation options (`--schema`, `--relaxng`, `--noout` etc.)<br>- Consider piping into other UnifyWeaver-friendly tools (`xmllint | jq`, `| awk`, etc.) |
| **xmlstarlet** (`engine(xmlstarlet)`) | Select + transform; supports large library of operations (edits, transforms, formatting); ubiquitous on Linux | Loads document in memory; CLI syntax is verbose; namespace handling requires manual declarations | - Document best practices for big queries (e.g. how to pre-limit scope)<br>- Provide helper templates for frequent tasks (attribute extraction, XSLT invocation) |
| **Other libxml2 tools** (`xmllint` family) | `xmllint` supports HTML tidy, canonicalisation, etc. | N/A | - Explore additional subcommands (e.g. `--format`, `--c14n`) as dedicated UnifyWeaver transforms |
| **Saxon / Java-based processors** | Full XPath/XQuery/XSLT 3.0; streaming; schema-aware processing | Requires JVM; heavier footprint; licensing for Saxon-EE | - Candidate for advanced transformations; would need firewall/workflow adjustments |
| **Rust/Go XML libs** | High-performance streaming; typed pipelines | Need new runtimes + sandbox permissions | - Worth tracking if we add Rust/Go targets in future |

## 2. Short-Term Ideas

1. **Python-free xmllint splitter**  
   Prototype a bash/awk (or Perl) pipeline to segment `xmllint --xpath` output into null-delimited records. If feasible, make namespace repair opt-in without pulling Python.

2. **XPath helper library**  
   Create a small Prolog helper that builds XPath expressions (including namespace bindings) to avoid hand-rolled strings in multiple places. Could support `descendant::`, attribute filters, etc.

3. **Namespace registry**  
   Move `known_namespace/2` into a shared configuration file so projects can add prefixes once and have them available to all engines (xmllint/xmlstarlet/potential future ones).

4. **Enhanced test coverage**  
   Add sample XML fixtures with:
   - default namespaces (no prefixes),
   - multiple prefixes referencing the same URI,
   - large CDATA sections and mixed content,
   to ensure each engine emits the expected fragments.

## 3. Medium-Term Opportunities

1. **Validation Workflow**  
   - Provide a new plugin or option (`validate(schema(Path))`) that runs `xmllint --schema`, `--relaxng`, or `--dtdvalid`.  
   - Capture validation errors and surface them in UnifyWeaver logs/tests.

2. **XSLT & Transformation Support**  
   - `xmlstarlet tr stylesheet.xsl file.xml` or `xsltproc`.  
   - Could compile into streaming pipelines for transforming XML into CSV/JSON for downstream tools.

3. **Selective Extraction**  
   - Support attribute-only extraction (e.g. stream values of `@rdf:about`).  
   - Possibly integrate with `xmlstarlet sel -T -t -m` for templated output.

4. **Incremental Parsing with Buffers**  
   - Extend iterparse engine to supply context objects (e.g. parent attributes, path) by augmenting the embedded Python code.  
   - Investigate chunking large text nodes for memory control.

## 4. Longer-Term Vision

1. **Unified XML Toolkit Module**  
   - Factor out common namespace/XPath utilities.  
   - Provide a consistent interface so new engines can be swapped in with minimal changes.

2. **Streaming Query Language**  
   - Build a DSL around XPath-lite expressions that choose the right engine automatically, similar to how `jq` does for JSON.  
   - Extend `xml_source` to compile full pipelines (select → transform → output).

3. **Cross-Language Interop**  
   - Explore hooking into `libxml2` bindings for other languages (Rust `xmlparser`, Go `encoding/xml`) for performance-critical tasks.  
   - Could be packaged as optional engines if the tooling is installed.

4. **XML + Semantic Web**  
   - Many datasets (RDF/XML, Atom, RSS) benefit from higher-level handling (e.g. RDF to triples). Consider dedicated plugins that convert XML sources into RDF triples or graph queries.

## 5. Open Questions

- When do we prefer CLI tools over Python, given the extra dependencies?  
- What is the threshold (file size, complexity) where xmlstarlet becomes impractical?  
- Should namespace repair be configurable at the global level instead of per-source?  
- How do we best expose XPath/XSLT knowledge to LLM agents (docs, prompts, helper predicates)?

Document status: **brainstorm**. Refine as we gather more experience with real XML workloads.
