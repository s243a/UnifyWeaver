This file replaces the older implementation plan. The four original C follow-up
items are now complete on `main`; the remaining work is feature parity with the
more mature hybrid WAM targets, especially Haskell and Rust.

## Current C Target Baseline

The C target is now a credible small WAM backend:

- Emits a C runtime and predicate setup functions.
- Supports core head/body WAM instructions for constants, variables,
  structures, lists, and unification.
- Supports `call`, `execute`, `proceed`, `allocate`, `deallocate`, and
  choice-point instructions.
- Supports `switch_on_constant`, `switch_on_structure`, `switch_on_term`,
  second-argument constant dispatch, and direct list dispatch.
- Supports basic `builtin_call` delegation for tested builtins:
  `atom/1`, `integer/1`, `is_list/1`, `=/2`, and `is/2`.
- Supports deterministic `call_foreign` dispatch through a C handler registry.
- Supports a deterministic native `category_ancestor/4` handler over an
  in-memory category-parent edge table.
- Supports loading category-parent facts from TSV through a small
  `WamFactSource` interface.
- Supports collecting all integer hop results for native `category_ancestor/4`
  through `WamIntResults`, while preserving deterministic first-result handler
  behavior.
- Can generate a small effective-distance C benchmark runner from Prolog facts,
  with both native-kernel and reference DFS modes over TSV category-parent
  facts.
- Can eagerly load category-parent facts from LMDB into the same `WamFactSource`
  edge storage used by TSV, behind the optional `WAM_C_ENABLE_LMDB` build flag.
- Can detect the shared `category_ancestor/4` recursive-kernel shape and emit
  C startup registration plus a `call_foreign` trampoline for generated
  projects.
- Is visible in the shared effective-distance benchmark matrix as TSV and LMDB
  `kernels_on` / `kernels_off` accumulated target pairs.
- Has executable smokes for generated runtime, cross-predicate calls,
  foreign calls, native category ancestor, file-backed facts, streaming native
  results, real multi-clause predicates, structure indexing, `is_list/1`, and
  `=/2`.

The main limitation is not core WAM execution anymore. It is hybrid-WAM
infrastructure: C lacks lowered/native helper integration and full benchmark
wiring that Haskell and Rust already have.

## Feature Parity Matrix

Legend: `Done` = covered by code/tests; `Partial` = basic support exists but is
missing important target features; `Missing` = no comparable C path yet.

| Capability | C | Rust | Haskell | C gap / next step |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Project generator | Partial | Done | Done | C writes runtime/lib files, but lacks Cargo/Cabal-like driver/test scaffolding depth. |
| Core WAM interpreter | Done | Done | Done | Keep C focused on executable correctness and memory safety. |
| Structures and lists | Done | Done | Done | C has executable smokes; broaden classic program coverage. |
| Choice points and backtracking | Done | Done | Done | Add deeper classic programs to stress retry/trust paths. |
| First-arg indexing | Done | Done | Done | C has constants, structures, mixed term, and list dispatch. |
| Second-arg indexing | Partial | Partial/Done | Partial/Done | C has constant A2 dispatch; broaden tests if this becomes hot. |
| Predicate dispatch map | Done | Done | Done | C now uses open-addressing hash table. |
| Builtin calls | Partial | Broader | Broader | C has a small builtin set. Add `functor/3`, `arg/3`, `atom_concat/3`, arithmetic comparisons as needed. |
| Aggregates (`findall`/`bagof`/`setof`) | Missing | Present in hybrid/lowered paths | Present in interpreter/lowered paths | Add only after C has enough runtime term-copy and list construction coverage. |
| Negation / control builtins | Partial | Broader | Broader | C likely needs explicit tests for `\+/1`, cut interactions, and if-then-else lowering. |
| Foreign predicate instruction (`CallForeign`) | Partial/Done | Done | Done | C has deterministic handler dispatch plus integer result collection for native kernels. |
| Native recursive kernels | Partial/Done | Done | Done | C has detected `category_ancestor/4` setup and all-hop collection; add more kernel kinds only after runtime support exists. |
| Shared kernel detector integration | Partial | Done | Done | C reuses `recursive_kernel_detection.pl` for `category_ancestor/4`; broaden as more native C kernels land. |
| Lowered/native helper functions | Missing | Done | Done | Consider after foreign kernels; C can lower simple fact-only or deterministic predicates. |
| FactSource abstraction | Partial | Partial/less central | Done | C has TSV category-parent loading; generalize beyond category edges as needed. |
| LMDB-backed facts | Partial/Done | Not primary | Done | C has optional eager LMDB loading for UTF-8 key/value category-parent facts and generated effective-distance LMDB wiring; larger artifact layout support remains. |
| Effective-distance benchmark harness | Partial/Done | Done | Done | C is wired into the shared matrix for TSV and LMDB `kernels_on`/`kernels_off`; next gap is larger artifact layouts. |
| Classic-program e2e suite | Partial | Partial/Done | Partial/Done | C has targeted smokes; add Fibonacci/Ackermann-style suite like Scala/Elixir. |
| Memory lifecycle | Partial | Runtime-managed | Runtime-managed | C has init/free; needs ASAN/Valgrind CI-style coverage for larger programs. |
| Instruction layout efficiency | TODO | N/A | N/A | Pack `Instruction` fields into a tagged union if runtime footprint matters. |

## Recommended Next Branches

### 1. `feat/wam-c-classic-program-e2e`

Goal: broaden C executable coverage with classic recursive programs.

Scope:

- Add Fibonacci/Ackermann-style generated executable smokes.
- Stress retry/trust, arithmetic comparisons, and recursive calls.
- Keep the suite small enough for routine local runs.

### 2. `perf/wam-c-pack-instruction`

Goal: reduce `Instruction` memory footprint.

Scope:

- Replace the current wide struct with a tagged union keyed by `WamInstrTag`.
- Keep setup emission readable.
- Add compile-time or smoke coverage to ensure every instruction arm reads the
  correct union member.

This is lower priority than hybrid parity. Do it only if generated program size
or cache behavior becomes a real bottleneck.

## Suggested Immediate Next Step

Finish `feat/wam-c-lmdb-effective-distance-wiring`, then start
`feat/wam-c-classic-program-e2e`.

The C target is now visible in the shared effective-distance matrix using TSV
and LMDB facts. The next parity gap is broader classic recursive program
coverage, which should stress retry/trust, arithmetic comparisons, and
recursive calls outside the effective-distance benchmark shape.
