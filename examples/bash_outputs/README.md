# UnifyWeaver Generated Examples

These bash scripts are example outputs from UnifyWeaver's test suite, demonstrating
the compiler's capabilities.

## License for These Examples

These specific example files are licensed under MIT OR Apache-2.0 as part of the
UnifyWeaver project.

## License for User-Generated Code

**Important:** When you use UnifyWeaver to compile your own Prolog programs, the
generated bash code is NOT encumbered by UnifyWeaver's license. You own the output
and can license it however you choose.

Similar to how:
- Code compiled by GCC is not GPL (despite GCC being GPL)
- Code generated by Bison/Flex is not GPL
- Code generated by ANTLR is not BSD

**UnifyWeaver's output belongs to you.**

These examples are licensed as MIT OR Apache-2.0 only because they're distributed
as part of the UnifyWeaver repository for demonstration purposes.
