# PowerShell Test Runner Follow-up

- [ ] Investigate hang in `parent.ps1` execution (inspect actual `uw-bash` command and environment)
- [ ] Verify compat layer exports `uw-bash` (10/19/2025)
- [ ] Ensure `test.ps1` runs both from `output/` and workspace root (with clear instructions)
- [ ] Document bash prerequisites (Cygwin, Git Bash, WSL) and compat behavior in `context/`
